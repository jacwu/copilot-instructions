# Coding Guidelines

## Naming Standards
- All names should be snake_case.
- Names should not be abbreviated.

## Magic Strings
- Avoid using magic strings. Either parameterize or create constants.

## Nesting
- Avoid deeply nested code. Break down logic into smaller functions.
- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Opening curly braces should be on the same line as the statement.
